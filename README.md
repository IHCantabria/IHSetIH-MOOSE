# IH-MOOSE

Jaramillo et al. (2021) proposed a hybrid model for embayed beaches, IH-MOOSE (Model Of Shoreline Evolution), by integrating cross-shore, planform and rotation equilibrium-based evolution models. In other words, IH-MOOSE combines the following models: (1) equilibrium cross-shore evolution model (Yates et al., 2009), (2) the equilibrium planform model (Hsu and Evans, 1989) and (3) the equilibrium shoreline rotation model (Jaramillo et al., 2021).
